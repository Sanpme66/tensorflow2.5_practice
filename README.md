# tensorflow2.5_practice
You will take the exam inside PyCharm. The exam infrastructure will create a project and install some software packages for you. You can install whatever other software you need as you take the exam. It is important that you don't change the version of TensorFlow within the exam project, because the grading infrastructure uses the same version of TensorFlow as the exam. What libraries will the exam infrastructure install? When you start the TensorFlow developer certificate exam, the exam framework will install the following software in your PyCharm project: tensorflow==2.5.0 tensorflow-datasets==4.3.0 Pillow==8.2.0 pandas==1.2.4 numpy==1.19.5 scipy==1.7.0
